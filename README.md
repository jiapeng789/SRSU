# SRSU: An Online Road Map Detection and Network Estimation for Structured Birdâ€™s-Eye View Road Scene Understanding

## Introduction
Road scene understanding plays a crucial role in autonomous driving as it is the basis for subsequent tasks such as decision-making and planning. The fundamental task is to understand the road map and network, where the road map provides fine-grained boundary information, and the road network provides rich topological information. Such road maps and networks are typically provided by offline annotated High-Definition (HD) maps. However, offline HD map construction is labor-intensive, costly to maintain, and difficult to cover all road scenes, limiting the flexibility of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). To bridge this gap, this paper proposes SRSU, an online road map detection and network estimation for structured bird's-eye view road scene understanding.

## Visualization results under different weather conditions
We visualize the results of SRSU under different weather conditions on the nuScenes val set. Visualization results show that the SRSU achieves
stable and impressive results in all weather conditions.
